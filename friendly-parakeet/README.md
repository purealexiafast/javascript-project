# Password Generator Project

## Description

The assignment was to write the JavaScript for a simple random password generator. In order to accomplish this task I had to make use of basic JavaScript concepts that we learned in class. I made use of variables, loops, functions and “if” statements. I initially found this to be a very difficult assignment as I had never studied JavaScript before, and the logic of it was hard for me to grasp. After working on it for quite some time, I could piece together a solution. I found the syntax hard to remember, but I know it will become second nature over time. I especially like seeing the effect of “prompts” and “confirm” as it created an immediate functional result. Overall this was a challenging but rewarding assignment.
